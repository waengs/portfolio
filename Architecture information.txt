The portfolio is structured by biodata, socials, hobbies and experience.
These are the categories that should provide comperhensive introduction to introduce my professional and personal life.
BIODATA
Main page shows you the biodata, who I am, my NIM, my class, gender and birthday.
These are basic information that someone who visits a portfolio might want to see at first glance.
SOCIALS
To further explore on who I am and my background you can proceed to my Socials page.
My socials page include my social media and where you can contact me easily.
HOBBIES
Next, my hobbies page shows you what I like to do in my down time and it gives you a better understanding of how I am as a person aside from academics.
EXPERIENCE
Lastly, my experience page shows you both my coding experience and my past educations, these are grouped together because they both can be defined by experience.
However there is a dropdown menu to showcase each section so that it is easier to find.
